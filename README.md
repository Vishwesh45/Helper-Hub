# Helper Hub

## Description

Helper Hub is a web application built with **React.js**, **React Router**, **Node.js**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. 

This platform aims to empower undervalued professionals such as drivers, child caretakers, maids, cooks, elder caretakers, gardeners, janitors, and other household helpers. It provides a bridge between these workers and the individuals or families in metropolitan cities who need their assistance. 

In today's fast-paced urban lifestyles, there is a growing demand for reliable help to manage household tasks, take care of children or elderly family members, and ensure overall household maintenance. Helper Hub addresses this need by enabling professionals to find work independently and helping users connect with trustworthy helpers.
