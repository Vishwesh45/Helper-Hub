# Helper Hub

## Description

Helper Hub is a web application built with **React.js**, **React Router**, **Node.js**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. 

Helper Hub is an innovative web application designed to connect undervalued professionals with individuals and families who need their services. In today's fast-paced metropolitan cities, managing household tasks, child care, elder care, and other responsibilities can be challenging. This platform bridges the gap between those seeking reliable help and the hardworking professionals who often go unnoticed in society.

Helper Hub empowers professionals such as drivers, child caretakers, maids, cooks, elder caretakers, gardeners, janitors, and other household workers to find work independently, without intermediaries. It provides a platform for these individuals to showcase their skills and connect directly with users, ensuring fair opportunities and mutual trust. By fostering these connections, Helper Hub aims to create a positive impact on both the lives of professionals and those in need of their services.

- **User Feedback**: Users can give feedback multiple times for each worker and book them multiple times.  
- **Worker Dashboard**: Workers do not have a personalized dashboard.  
- **UI & Frontend**: The user interface is basic and needs significant improvements for better user experience.
